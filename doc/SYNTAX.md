# Object Oriented C Syntax

The language is still at a very early stage. Currently it can only store integers in variables and exit with a code.
OOC is a statically typed language, so to create a variable one must declare its type. Currently `int` is the only type.
Each statement in the language must end with a `;`.
Only one function can be called in this language at this time, and it is `exit()`.

The `exit()` function is written in assembly by the compiler at compile time. It can accept an `int` as a parameter to manually assign an exit code to the program.
